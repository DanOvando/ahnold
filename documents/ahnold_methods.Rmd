## Methods

### Econometric Model

... DiD framework etc. 

The econometric model is a Bayesian hierarchichal delta-GLM model. 

Each observation in the database represents the mean density *d* of a species of "classcode" *c* at site-side *s* in year *y*. 

$$ d_{c,s,y} = \sum{\beta_{c,i}c_{i}} + \sum{\beta_{s,i}s_{i} + \sum{\beta_{y,i},y_{i}} $$
