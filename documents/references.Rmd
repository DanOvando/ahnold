Using an state space integral projection model

# watson2014b - The performance and potential of protected areas

There is also strong evi- dence that protected areas maintain species population levels (including threatened species) better than other management approaches17,21â€“25. For example, well-managed marine protected areas (MPAs) have been found to contain more than 5 times the total large fish biomass and 14 times the shark biomass compared with fished areas - sites lester 2009


Broadly, makes a strong review of state of global protected areas. Shouldn't really use a stand-alone citation for density-ratios = population effects; they do say it but it's in such a throw away sentence that hard to make the case strongly based on that

Provide genetic evidence for fish born in MPA to recruit outside of MPA

right, need to review sale 2005 again
