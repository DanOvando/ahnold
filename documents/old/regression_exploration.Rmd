Now that you've finally gotten a handle on the hierarchical nature of the data, your next task before your meeting is to dive deeper into regression, and see how sensitive your results are to modeling assumptions.

## Candidate variables

Data exploration and candidate variable selection.

Correlation plots among data, relationships between data and variables of interest

## Bare-bones regression

Apply simple Bayesian model to full model

## Apply `rstanarm` regression

Now use `rstanarm` to fit a hierarchichal model, using `stan_glmer`

Standard diagnostics

## Apply using custom `STAN`

Try and replicate the above, but using your own `stan` code

Standard diagnostics


## Expanded hierarchy

Try out the double nested thing from Gelman and Hill, where you estiamte species specific fixed effects, which come from a distribution with mean defined by life history traits 

Standard diagnostics
