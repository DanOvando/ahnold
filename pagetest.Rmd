## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

\pagebreak

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="test"}
plot(pressure)
```

\newpage

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

hello world
\newpage
```{r, echo=FALSE}
1+1
```

\pagebreak

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```

\pagebreak

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```

\newpage

hello?
